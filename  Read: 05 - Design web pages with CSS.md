# How CSS Improves HTML
>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) was a technology recommended by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) in 1996. An easy way to understand the purpose of CSS is to view it as an addition to HTML that helps simplify and improve web page design. In fact, some CSS effects are not possible via HTML alone. 

>you use CSS to define general rules about how the elements in your web pages behave and how they look — where they’re located, their size, their opacity, and so on. Then you can merely refer to the rule’s name whenever you want to enforce it within your HTML page.

## top key notes about CSS
1.CSS uses rules to indicate how that
    HTML element should look.
2.Rules are made up of selectors (that specify the
elements the rule applies to) and declarations (that
indicate what these elements should look like).
3.Declarations are made up of two parts: the properties
of the element that you want to change, and the values
of those properties.
4.CSS rules usually saved in a separate document,
although they may appear within an HTML page(not a best practice).
